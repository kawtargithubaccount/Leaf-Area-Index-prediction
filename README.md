Leaf Area Index (LAI) Prediction Using Regression
Project Overview

This project predicts the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of plants using regression techniques. LAI is a key indicator in plant physiology and ecology, representing the total leaf area per unit ground area. Accurate LAI prediction is essential for agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring.

This project leverages machine learning regression models to estimate LAI from input features, such as leaf characteristics, environmental parameters, or remote sensing data.

Features
